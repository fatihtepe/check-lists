[AN INTERACTIVE IP ADDRESS AND CIDR RANGE VISUALIZER](https://cidr.xyz/)

[CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) is a notation for describing blocks of IP addresses and is used heavily in various networking configurations. IP addresses contain 4 octets, each consisting of 8 bits giving values between 0 and 255. The decimal value that comes after the slash is the number of bits consisting of the routing prefix. This in turn can be translated into a netmask, and also designates how many available addresses are in the block.
