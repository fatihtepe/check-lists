* [Security groups are stateful](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html)â€”if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of the inbound rules. This also means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of the outbound rules.

* VPC ==> All our resources should be under same VPC you need to define VPC id here. Then, resources (secgroup, targetgroup) can talk each other.  

* ![SecurityGroups IDs](./img/img6.png) `CallApplicationLoadBalancer's` securityGroups IDs 

* ![GetAtt](./img/img7.png) `!GetAtt` function

* ![LoadBalancerArn](./img/img10.png)

* [AWS ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) uniquely identify AWS resources. We require an ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) tags, and API calls.

* An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is a file naming convention used to identify a particular resource in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud. ARNs, which are specific to AWS, help an administrator track and use AWS items and policies across AWS products and API calls.

[Fn::Base64](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-base64.html)
The intrinsic function Fn::Base64 returns the Base64 representation of the input string. This function is typically used to pass encoded data to Amazon EC2 instances by way of the UserData property.

[Fn::FindInMap](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-findinmap.html) The intrinsic function Fn::FindInMap returns the value corresponding to keys in a two-level map that is declared in the Mappings section.
