- `HealthyThresholdCount: 3`
- `Port: 80`
- `Protocol: HTTP`
- `TargetType: instance`
- `UnhealthyThresholdCount: 3`
- `VpcId: !Ref CallVPC` ==> we need to define VPC and call it with !Ref*
- DELETE all other lines under `CallAlBTargetGroup` <==(LogicalId)
```

```
- Go top under `Description:` 
- write `Parameters:`
- write `para` under `Parameters` (list popup) select `parameter-type-vpc-id` 
- rename `ParameterName` variable as `CallVPC`
- define `Description:`=> `Select the VPC for your application from the list.`

- go under `CallAlBTargetGroup`
- write `elasticload` (list popup) select `elasticloadbalancingv2-loadbal...` enter
- rename `LogicalId` as `CallApplicationLoadBalancer:`
- keep `Type:` under `CallApplicationLoadBalancer:` as is
- keep the 'Type' bottom  and rename `String` as `application`
- keep `Properties`
- under `Properties` I defined SecurityGroups before and I need `IDs` of security group*   
- `!GetAtt CallSecGroup.GroupId` previously defined `CallSecGroup` and attribute `GroupId` 
- keep `Subnets:' and Go Top Under `Parameters` define subnet lists and we will use `!Ref CallSubnets` here. 
- DELETE all other lines under `CallApplicationLoadBalancer:` <==(LogicalId)
```
![subnets](./img/img8.png)
```
- under Parameters write `para` (list pop) we need more than one subnet therefore we will select `parameter-type-subnet-id-list` List means we can select more than one.

* [Security groups are stateful](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html)â€”if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of the inbound rules. This also means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of the outbound rules.

* VPC ==> All our resources should be under same VPC you need to define VPC id here. Then, resources (secgroup, targetgroup) can talk each other.  

* ![SecurityGroups IDs](./img/img6.png) `CallApplicationLoadBalancer's` securityGroups IDs 

* ![GetAtt](./img/img7.png) `!GetAtt` function
