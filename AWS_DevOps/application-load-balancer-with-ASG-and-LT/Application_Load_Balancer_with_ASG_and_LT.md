* [Security groups are stateful](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html)â€”if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of the inbound rules. This also means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of the outbound rules.
