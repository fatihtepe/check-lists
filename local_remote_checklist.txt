### Create a local repo on your computer then push to Github (without using git clone) ###

1. mkdir test   (on your terminal create a directory for example test)
2. cd test 
3. git init (or you can skip 1., 2., steps and directly write "git init test" (directory name)
4. git branch -m main (if your branch name is master change it to main if it is main, skip)
5. Create a repository on Github [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) (copy url address of your repo)
6. git remote add origin [git@github.com](mailto:git@github.com):fatihtepe/test.git  (remote repository github)
7. git pull origin main
8. here you can create as many as file you want then git add . ==> git commit -m 'message'
	if you want to change your message ==> git commit --amend -m "write your new message"
	""" After git add . ==> To Undo these command 

		1. git reset README.md (file name here it is README file) 

		To Undo Commit

		1. git reset HEAD~1 (HEAD point last commit go 1 back)"""

9. git push origin main 
10. Check your github account you will see your repo there

#### Creating a Remote Repo on GitHub ###

1. Sign into https://github.com (give a name (for example 
	"creating_repoManual" this name will be directory name on your 
	computer , select initiating Add a README file, Public etc.)
2. Click 'Create repository' button
3. Copy https url address [https://github.com/fatihtepe/creating_repoManual.git]
	https://github.com/fatihtepe/creating_repoManual.git)
4. Open Terminal
5. cd  where you keep your git repos
6. git clone h[ttps://github.com/fatihtepe/creating_repoManual.git]
	(https://github.com/fatihtepe/creating_repoManual.git) 
	now we cloned your github repository to our working area
7. cd creating_repo Manual 
8. You don`t need to use git init to initiate a repo when you clone it from remote
9. git branch (before creating new new branch let's check where we are 
10. git branch manual (creating manual branch)
11. git checkout manual (we are now on manual branch)
12. git branch ( check again and see the new branch green colored)
13. touch repoManual.txt (creating a txt file etc.)
14. ls (here you will see [README.md] and repoManual.txt)
15. open repoManual.txt file and work on it..
15. cat repoManual.txt (you can check!) WORKING DIRECTORY
16. git status (you will see there red coloured file/s)
16. git add repoManual.txt ( or just dot . for all files, STAGING AREA)
17. git commit -m "Repository Manual for Beginners" (committing Local Repository)
18. git log (check your log)
19. git push origin manual (pushing branch to remote..we do not need to use 
	(git remote add origin) command because we cloned our repo 
	from remote and both are already associated with each other)
20. Let's go and check our github, remote, repo. We have two branch (main and manual)now. 
21. Compare & pull request (click here to open pull request you 
	will see there 'Able to merge' remark.your last commist message will be inserted automatically. 
	Click green coloured 'Create pull request'
22. Merge pull request (there you will see no conflict to merge and click Merge pull request)
23. Confirm merge
24. Pull request successfully merged and closed.
25. Click Code tab to see how the repo looks like after merge. 
	As you see manual branch is merged to the main branch.

### Final Notes! ###

	We have two branch in this example main and manual , a new branch 
	(manual) on our local repo and pushed it to remote repo. Now, our remote repo 
	(Github) is on main branch and up to date, but local repo is not. So,
	
First, switch to main branch

$ git checkout main

Then type

$ git pull origin main

GREAT!!

NOW 

Everything up-to-date
